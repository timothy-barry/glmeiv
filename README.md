# glmeiv

GLM-EIV is GLM-oriented variant of the errors-in-variables model.
GLM-EIV models the response as a GLM of an unobserved predictor. A noisy
version of the predictor is observed, which itself is modeled as a GLM
of the true predictor. The `glmeiv` package implements estimation and
inference in the GLM-EIV model.
