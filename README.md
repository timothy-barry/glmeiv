# glmeiv

GLM-EIV is GLM-oriented extension of the classical errors-in-variables model. This repository primarily is intended for reproduction of the results reported in the paper "Exponential
family measurement error models for single-cell CRISPR screens." Users who wish to employ the gRNA-only mixture assignment functionality
of GLM-EIV to assign gRNAs to cells should reference the [sceptre package](https://katsevich-lab.github.io/sceptre/).
