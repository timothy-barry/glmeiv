# glmeiv

GLM-EIV is GLM-oriented variant of the errors-in-variables model. GLM-EIV models the response as a GLM of an unobserved predictor. A noisy version of the predictor is observed, which itself is modeled as a GLM of the true predictor. The `glmeiv` package implements estimation and inference in the GLM-EIV model.

# Installation
